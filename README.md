This is the open home of developing of a customised openMX distribution / kernel for Spectra, perhaps to be used in later versions to replace the (in my opinion, bad) current kernel.

However, most probably, Microconsen will be used.
This repo is kept as a fallback, in case something goes wrong with the migration or we need for some reason to rebase to MX.
